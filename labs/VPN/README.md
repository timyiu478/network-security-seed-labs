# VPN Lab

## For Ubuntu 20.04 VM and for containers

There is no problem porting this lab to Ubuntu 20.04.
Because this is a comprehensive lab, we will leave it to 
students to set up the container environment if they choose to
use containers, instead of VMs. Both options are allowed. 
Therefore, we will not update this lab using containers.
