# Meltdown Attack Lab

## Porting to Ubuntu 20.04 (Unsuccessful)

This lab was originally developed on the 32-bit Ubuntu 16.04. 
We are trying to port it to the 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04, but due to 
the mitigation mechanisms implemented in Ubuntu 20.04, the attack
does not work anymore. However, Tasks 1-6 work on both VMs; only the 
actual attack (Tasks 7 and 8) will fail on 20.04.
