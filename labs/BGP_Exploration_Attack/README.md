# BGP Exploration and Attack Lab

This lab uses the SEED Internet Emulator as the basis
to show show students how the BGP works and how to
launch the BGP attack (network prefix hijacking). 


## TO-DO List

- Due to the complexity of the BIRD configuration, it will
  be very helpful if we can record a YouTube video to 
  explain the configuration. I already have a BGP lecture
  on YouTube that focuses on the theory part. We need one
  on the practical side.
