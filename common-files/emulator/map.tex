Each computer (hosts or routers) running inside the emulator is a docker container.
Users can access these computers using docker commands, such as getting a shell
inside a container.
The emulator also comes with a web application, which visualizes all the hosts, routers,
and networks.
After the emulator starts, the map can be accessed from this
URL: \url{http://localhost:8080/map.html}.
See Figure~\ref{emulator:fig:emulator-gui}.
To zoom in/out, use the mouse middle scroll. 
Click on any node, the detailed information of that node
will be displayed on the side panel, from where,
users can get a console on that node (container).
