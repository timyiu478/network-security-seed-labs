%\section*{Submission and Demonstration}


You should submit a detailed lab report to describe your design and implementation.
You should also describe how you test the functionalities and
security of your system. You also need to demonstrate your system to us. 
Please sign up a demonstration time slot with the TA. Please take
the following into consideration when you prepare for demonstration:

\begin{itemize}

\item The total time of the demo will be 15 minutes, no more additional time would be
given. So prepare your demonstration so you can cover the important features.  

\item You are entirely responsible for showing the demo. 
We will NOT even touch the keyboard during the
demonstration; so you should not depend on us to test your system. If you fail to demo
some important features of your system, we will assume that your system does not
have those features. 

\item You need to practice before you come to the demonstration. 
If the system crashes or anything goes wrong, it is your own fault. We will not 
debug your problems, nor give you extra time for it. 

\item 
During the demo, you should consider yourself as salesmen, and you want to sell
your system to us. You are given 15 minutes to show us how good your system is.
So think about your sales strategies. If you have implemented a great system,
but fail to show us how good it is, you are not likely to get a good grade. 

\item 
Do turn off the messages your system prints out for debugging purposes. 
Those messages should not appear in a demonstration.


\end{itemize}
