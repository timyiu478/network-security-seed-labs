Code editing is more convenient inside the VM than in containers, 
because we can use our favorite editors.
In order for the VM and container to share files, 
we have created a shared folder between the VM and the container
using the Docker \texttt{volumes}.
If you look at the Docker Compose file, you will find out that
we have added the following entry to some of the containers.
It indicates mounting the \texttt{./volumes} folder on the host
machine (i.e., the VM) to the \texttt{/volumes} folder inside the container.
We will write our code in the \texttt{./volumes} folder (on the VM), so they
can be used inside the containers.

volumes:
       - ./volumes:/volumes
