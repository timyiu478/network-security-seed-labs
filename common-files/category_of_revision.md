# Categories of Changes for Ubuntu 20.04

We use four categories to describe how much change is made to
the lab description and files.
- ```None```: No change is made

- ```Editorial```: No essential change is made; only editorial changes.

- ```Minor```: Essential change is made, and the change is minor.

- ```Major```: Essential change is made, and the change is quite significant.

- ```New```: This is a new lab specifically designed for Ubuntu 20.04.
It could be from an existing lab, but the lab is completely redesigned.
